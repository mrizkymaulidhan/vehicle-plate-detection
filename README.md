# Vehicle Number Plate Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a desktop application using the Python programming language. The application is designed for recognizing and detecting vehicle number plates. Leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, specifically Tesseract, users can capture images of vehicle number plates and automatically identify and detect the text present on those plates.

## Key Features

- **OCR Technology Integration**: Utilizes Tesseract OCR to recognize and extract text from images of vehicle number plates.
- **Number Plate Detection**: Capable of detecting and isolating vehicle number plates within images.
- **Python-based Desktop Application**: Developed using Python for simplicity and ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- Python and it's libraries
- Tesseract OCR

## Functionality

The application offers the following functionalities:

- Image capture for vehicle number plates
- Text extraction and recognition from captured images
- Display recognized number plate information

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install required dependencies.
2. **Launching the Application**: Run the main application file to start the number plate recognition interface.
3. **Capturing Images**: Use the application to capture images of vehicle number plates.
4. **Text Recognition**: Identify and display the text from the captured number plates.

## Future Enhancements

- Enhance accuracy and speed of number plate recognition.
- Implement additional features such as real-time and database integration for storing recognized plate information.
